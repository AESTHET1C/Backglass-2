# Backglass 2 Pinball Controller Board

An Arduino Uno-compatible unified control board tailored to the Eli Whitney Museum 2017 summer pinball project.

Uses the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller for user code, along with an ATmega8U2/ATmega16U2 for serial communication and code upload, and an ATmega48PB as an audio/visual coprocessor.

A user-oriented code library can be found here: [TODO]

The coprocessor firmware can be found here: <https://github.com/AESTHET1C/Backglass-2-Firmware>
